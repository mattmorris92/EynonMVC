    <h1>Software Development Is Complicated</h1>
    <p>
    Many people recognize the complicated nature of software when they see code for the first time. However, the code is most likely confusing because the
    viewer does not understand the syntax. Syntax is just the grammar of the language; much like English has its own grammar rules. Unlike English, however,
    syntax is actually relatively simple. And, it's not why software development is so complicated. The reason software development is complicated, is because
    it forces us to recognize and take action on the real problems with a project.

    Twenty years of experience in software development over hundreds of projects reveal a lot about how these processes work. Having this insight on projects
    allows us to simplify both the software and the project. I have learned from many different developers and resources about how to best secure applications against
    vulnerabilities, improve performance, and most importantly, make the application work the way you want it to.
