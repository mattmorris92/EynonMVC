            Yup. There’s not really much avoiding it. We actually enjoy what we do in a discipline where many struggle to find motivation other than money. Software development is one of the most promising disciplines from a career standpoint. However, not many people actually enjoy writing software. And that’s why we’re weird. Because we enjoy it. We enjoy helping people solve problems. We love to innovate. That watch you gave us when we were kids… Yeah. We took it apart. It was more fun learning how the watch worked than reading the time on it. And that’s why we’re here.

    <h1>About Thomas Eynon (President)</h1>

            "I started developing software when I was nine years old. Our grandmother bought a computer for our family for Christmas. Originally, we were just playing games on it, but eventually those games made me wonder… How does this magical box create these images that respond to me? And I started tinkering. I remember in my early teens learning how to disable the dial-up modems noise… Why? So my mom wouldn’t hear it connecting to the internet as I spent all night learning how to create web pages and write Javascript. Or when I was 17, and the hurricane Katrina disaster had just happened. I ended up racking up my mothers phone bill to something like $500 after I built a volunteer coordination website. It was actually that project, I think, that showed me how important it is to understand the entire process for a project. At that point in time, just about everyone was in WAY over their head.”
